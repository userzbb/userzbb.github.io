## ✨ Features

Momo originates from Xiaohongshu📕, serving as the default nickname for every new user—symbolizing a fresh start. This philosophy guides our blog design, striking a balance between complex functionality and minimalist aesthetics.

* **Minimalist Design**: Clean page layout with black and white as primary colors, accented by blue
* **Dark Mode**: Supports manual switching or automatic system adaptation
* **Article Search**: Implements localized search using [pagefind](https://pagefind.app/)
* **Internationalization (i18n)**: Supports multilingual switching, currently available in Simplified Chinese and English
* **Mobile Adaptation**: Components optimized for mobile devices, delivering the same experience as desktop browsers
* **Commenting**: Supports local deployment and Cloudflare deployment. See [Backend](https://github.com/Motues/Momo-Backend) for details
* **Extensive Markdown syntax**: Supports Katex, Typst, and Alert components, GitHub cards, custom syntax, and more
* **Local CMS**: Start it with `pnpm cms` to edit posts with live preview instead of editing Markdown by hand
* **Command line tool**: `pnpm momo` provides config backup/restore, one-command updates, new post creation and environment checks
* Other core features: Article categories, directory, RSS subscription, text statistics, reading time

## 🚀 Quick Start

> Requirements: Node.js **>= 22** (24 LTS recommended) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)

1. Clone this project
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Motues/Momo.git
    cd Momo
    ```
2. Run `pnpm install` to install dependencies (use `npm install -g pnpm` to install `pnpm`)
3. Run `pnpm dev` to start the development server

## 🔧 Configuration

Refer to the [Configuration Guide](./config_en.md). For detailed information, visit [Momo](https://momo.motues.top/en/intro/config) and read the corresponding articles.

Site information, theme switches, languages and the Cover text of each page are configured in `src/config.ts`; the `site` and `i18n` fields of `astro.config.mjs` read from that file automatically.

## 📚 Updating

Refer to the [Update Guide](./release_en.md) for instructions on updating your project. Visit [Momo](https://momo.motues.top/en/intro/release) for detailed information.

Run `pnpm momo update` to do it automatically: it backs up your config, pulls the update and installs dependencies, then lists the config files that need manual merging.

## 🍃 Branch

Below are some branches that are maintained on an irregular basis; we cannot guarantee that they will remain in sync with the `main` branch.

* `memos`: Implements the Memos card feature
* `v5`: Version v5—no longer supported
