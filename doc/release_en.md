# Update Guide

This project is currently under active maintenance. To update, follow these steps:

First, verify the version number in `package.json` or review the changelog here or at [Release](https://github.com/Motues/Momo/releases).

The project version number is only incremented when the configuration file structure undergoes structural changes. Project configuration files refer to those related to website layout and content, including `astro.config.mjs`, `src/config.ts`, `src/content.config.ts`, and files within the `src/i18n/` folder.

Blog text, images, and other content are stored in the `src/content/`, `src/assets`, and `public` folders.

## Version Number Unchanged

You can directly clone this project, then overwrite the new project with your original configuration files. Run `pnpm install` to install dependencies, followed by `pnpm build` for local compilation. Finally, execute `pnpm preview` to preview the compiled project.

When updating inside this repository, run `pnpm momo update`: it backs up your own `src/config.ts` to `.backup/`, pulls the remote update, installs dependencies, and finally lists the **configuration files that need to be merged by hand**. If something goes wrong with `src/config.ts` afterwards, `pnpm momo restore` rolls it back to the state before the update.

## Version Number Changed

Whenever the version number changes, the modification log will be updated here. Refer to the specific log entries to modify the corresponding configuration files.

Below are general modification suggestions.

* **`astro.config.mjs` Modifications**: Typically just overwrite the file. Its `site` and `i18n` fields are read from `siteConfig.rootSiteUrl`, `i18nConfig.defaultLanguage` and `i18nConfig.supportedLanguages` in `src/config.ts`.
* **`config.ts` Modifications**: Update `config.ts` by adding or modifying configuration items as required.
* **`content.config.ts` Modifications**: Typically involves adding new frontmatter configurations to articles. Add the required new configuration items to articles as specified.
* **`src/i18n/` Modifications**: Generally involves adding new internationalization translations; simply overwrite the files. Note that the Cover text of each page (`cover.title` / `cover.subTitle`) has moved into `i18nConfig.translations` in `src/config.ts` — edit it there.
